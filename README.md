# CalendarPlus

## Purpose

For many of us, time is the most precious
resource as it can never be returned. As
such, time budgeting has become one of the
most important tools in our daily lives. It is
not only about knowing what one might do
at what time and for how long, but also
about other important details such as the
specific details of planned events and the
location of such events. Along the way, one
might even desire to be reminded of
important events some time before event
start. Indeed, a calendar application would
promote personal accountability, realistic
event/task duration estimation, task
prioritization, and event time boundary
setting.

Calendar+ is designed to fulfill these
needs. As a web application, it can be
accessed from a Windows laptop with an
Internet connection anywhere in the world.
